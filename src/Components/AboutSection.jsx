                    <p>I am Junior Fullstack Developer able to build a Web presence from the ground up - from concept, navigation,
                        layout and programming to UX and SEO. Skilled at writing well-designed, testable and efficient code using
                        current best practices in Web development. I am a fast learner, hard worker and team player who is proficient in
                        an array of scripting languages and multimedia Web tools.

                    <p>I am currently a software developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://broadspectrumltd.com/" rel="noreferrer">Broadspectrum Ghana</a>, where I help build payment gateways. 
                        Before joining Broadspectrum, I obtained a first-class bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana.

                        My primary research interests include Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, Embedded Systems, Robotics and Internet of Things (IoT). 
                        I am very interested in working at the intersection of Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) to build the next generation intelligent computer systems that would allow us to fully harness the power of AI/ML to solve problems. 
                        I am very open to exploring new fields and learning about new things.
